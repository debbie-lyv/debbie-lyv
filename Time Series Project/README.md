This project analyzes the difference in average climate per year from 1850 to 2023 (in degrees celsius) in order to forecast the global land and ocean temperature anomalies

This data is important to examine as it provides scientific evidence for the effects of climate change, and can further inform us of what our future on this Earth will look like. From a first glance, the data suggests that global temperatures rose rapidly from 1976 to the current day, reaching heights of +1.03â„ƒ more than the global base period average. After investigating these results, findings should be used to spur policymakers to make decisions in order to change our current trajectory with an alarming rate of global warming.

This project uses R: data was transformed, ARIMA models were generated, future temperatures were forecast, and forecasts were bootstrapped

Final bootstrapped forecast:
